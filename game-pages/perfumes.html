        <h2>Well done!</h2>
        <p>If you managed to complete that quiz without the help of Google, an AI assistant or a football nerd beside you, your soccer knowledge is peak! (We should chat about our favourite teams together. Mine's Manchester City. Up the blues!!)</p>
        <p>Anywayyy, let's move on to a very very very <span style="font-family: cursive;">quirky</span> hobby of mine: perfumery. Yes, you read that right, I do indeed sniff, buy, use and make perfumes.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, perfumes can be divided into several different types depending on their oil concentrations. (Most perfumes are derived from fragrance oils dissolved in an alcohol solvent. Except Muslim/Arabic perfumes, which tend to avoid alcohol solvents due to religious reasons.) From less oils to more oils, fragrances can be divided into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#ef">Eau Fraîche</a>(French for 'Fresh Water', 1-3% oils, 1-2hrs of longetivity), </li>
            <li><a href="#edc">Eau de Cologne</a>(French for 'Water of Cologne', 2-4% oils, 1-2hrs of longetivity), </li>
            <li><a href="#edt">Eau de Toilette</a>(French for 'Water of toilet', 5-15% oils, 3-6hrs of longetivity), </li>
            <li><a href="#edp">Eau de Parfum</a>(French for 'Water of perfume', 15-20% oils, 6-10hrs of longetivity), </li>
            <li><a href="#pf">Parfum</a>(French for 'Perfume', 20-40% oils, 10-24hrs of longetivity), </li>
            <li><a href="#exdp">Extrait de Parfum</a>(French for 'Perfume Extract', >20% oils, >10hrs of longetivity), </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="hero">
        <h2>Types of perfumes</h2>
        <h3 id="ef">Eau Fraîche</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/eau_fraiche.webp" alt="Versace's Eau Fraîche" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">
            <figcaption>Versace's Man Eau Fraîche. ©️Versace</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>
        <p>The fragrance with the least concentration, usually containing only 1-3% of fragrance oils. Very weak and mild. Extremely short longetivity of 1-2hr. Suited for a quick refresh, hot weather and those whose skin is sensitive to alcohol.</p>

        <h3 id="edc">Eau de Cologne</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/eau_de_cologne.jpeg" alt="AdP's EdC" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">
            <figcaption>Acqua di Parma's Colonia Eau de Cologne. ©️AdP</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>
        <p>The fragrance with a slightly higher concentration than Eau Fraîche, usually containing 2-4% of fragrance oils. Mild and refreshing. Short longetivity of 1-2hr. Suited for casual use, especially when you don't want an overpowering scent/fragrance. Although the word "Cologne" is commonly used to refer to men's perfumes, eau de colognes refer to any fragrance, regardless of gender, that meets the requirement of 2-4% oil concentration. Additionally, mens' fragrances are not limited to eau de colognes, and instead span a wide range of concentrations, from eau de colognes to extrait de parfums.</p>

        <h3 id="edt">Eau de Toilette</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/eau_de_toilette.webp" alt="Chanel's Eau de Toilette" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">
            <figcaption>Chanel's Bleu de Chanel (BdC) Eau de Toilette. ©️Chanel</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>
        <p>Eau de Toilette, often shortened to simply EdT in online fragrance forums, describes a fragrance with a higher oil concentration than Eau de Cologne, usually containing 5-15% of fragrance oils. Fresh and bright, EdTs usually focus on top and heart notes. Moderate longetivity of 3-6hrs. Suited for daily use at home or at the office, especially when you want a subtle scent that lasts longer than an eau fraîche or eau de cologne but does not exterminate your colleagues'/family members' sense of smell.</p>
        
        <h3 id="edp">Eau de Parfum</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/eau_de_parfum.jpeg" alt="Dior's EdP" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">
            <figcaption>Dior's Sauvage Eau de Parfum. ©️Dior</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>
        <p>Often given a nasty reputation due to its sillage (Imagine your fragrance smell creating a bubble of fragrance around you, like a protego spell. Sillage describes the strength of the perfume, measured by how big that bubble feels.) and longetivity, eau de parfums are perfume-world heavyweights. They contain 15-20% fragrance oils, offering a strong scent that lasts 6-8 hours. Suited for evening/air-conditioned environment wear or special occasions when you want a bold, long-lasting fragrance.</p>
        <p>Over the years, however, Sauvage EdP has sort of gotten a bad reputation due to teenagers overspraying the fragrance in confined spaces -- leading it to become associated with poor fragrance wearing practices. It is, however, still an excellent fragrance to wear at formal occasions -- with minimal sprays, though!</p>

        <h3 id="pf">Parfum</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/parfum.jpeg" alt="Dior's Dior Homme Parfum 100ml" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">
            <figcaption>Dior's Dior Homme Parfum. ©️Dior</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>
        <p>Parfum, also known as "perfume" in the US, is the second-most concentrated form of fragrance, containing 20-40% fragrance oils. It offers the longest-lasting scent and is often considered the most luxurious and expensive type of fragrance. Rich and intense, parfums develop (evaporate) slowly, and are ideal for special occasions or when you want a long-lasting, intense fragrance that will last all day. Due to its extreme sillage and longtivity, parfums should be used sparingly in order to not become an olfactory hazard.</p>
        
        <h3 id="exdp">Extrait de Parfum</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/extrait_de_parfum.jpeg" alt="MFK's Baccarat Rouge Extrait" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">

            <br>
        </figure>
        <p>Extraits de Parfum, also known as "Extraits", are the most concentrated form of fragrance, containing >40% fragrance oils. As an extrait refers to a fragrance with the highest concentration of oils, there is no set limit for its concentration. Different perfume houses and perfumers use different scales to define extraits. Some houses even stop at parfum as the highest concentration.</p>
        <p>Extraits (or their parfum counterparts, if they don't exist) offer the longest-lasting scent and are considered the most luxurious and expensive type of fragrance. Extremely slow to develop, extraits are intense and multilayered, developing from top notes to heart notes then to base notes. As one or two sprays will last for almost a day, extraits are ideal for special occasions or when you want a long-lasting, intense fragrance. Caution: If you ever do purchase a bottle of extrait, DO NOT overspray.</p>

        <h2>Fragrance Lingo!</h2>
        <p>Aside from concentrations, understanding the terminology used in the fragrance world can help you make informed decisions when choosing a scent. Here are some key terms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top Notes:</strong> The initial scents perceived immediately after application. They are usually light and evaporate quickly. Common top notes: citrus, mandarins, bergamot.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Notes:</strong> The core of the fragrance that emerges after the top notes fade. They are more robust and last longer. Common heart notes: rose, jasmine, sandalwood, lavender.</li>
            <li><strong>Base Notes:</strong> The foundation of the fragrance that appears once the heart notes dissipate. They are rich, deep, and long-lasting. Common base notes: vanilla, patchouli, cedarwood, musk.</li>
            <li><strong>Sillage:</strong> The trail of scent left behind by the wearer. It indicates how far the fragrance projects from the skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Longetivity:</strong> The duration a fragrance lasts on the skin before it fades away.</li>
            <li><strong>Flanker:</strong> A variation of an existing fragrance, often with a different concentration or scent profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Nose:</strong> The person (perfumer) who creates a fragrance.</li>
            <li><strong>Designer:</strong> A fragrance that is created by a fashion house or brand. These scents are usually mass-market and universally pleasing. However, do note that certain fragrances from certain houses may not be classified as a designer if they are uncommon enough to be niche.</li>
            <li><strong>Niche:</strong> A fragrance that is created by a niche perfumer or brand. These scents are usually limited in production and are often unique or experimental. Famous houses include L'artisan Parfumeur, Diptyque, MFK, Zoologist and Le Labo. Note: Being niche doesn't automatically make it smell nicer or better. People often mistake originality for scent quality. Certain niche fragrances like Zoologist Bat are meant to be appreciated as a scent by itself and may not make the best fragrance to wear outside or to meet other people.</li>
            <li><strong>Ambroxan:</strong> A synthetic molecule used in perfumery to create a warm, woody scent. It is often used as a base note and is known for its longevity and fixative properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Opening:</strong> The initial scent that is perceived when a fragrance is first applied. It is the first impression of the fragrance and can be quite different from the overall scent profile. It usually consists of the top notes only.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry Down:</strong> The final stage of a fragrance's development, where the scent settles into its base notes and becomes more stable and long-lasting. Usually composed of the base notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong> A specific time of the year when a fragrance is most suitable to wear. Fresh fragrances are typically considered spring/summer fragrances, while warm, spicy scents are considered fall/winter scents. I do not, however, believe in seasons. To me, fragrances are all-year. You can wear a sweet-spicy scent (think honey and pepper) in summer, so long as you keep sprays to the minimum.</li>
            <li>And there's a lot more, but then this list would never end...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Journey into Fragrances</h2>
        <p>For some reason, this fragrance page is super duper long. But that's okay, because it's informative. I hope.</p>
        <p>My own journey into fragrances began with a simple curiosity about the scents that surround us daily. Scents seem to have a weird way of evoking memories and emotions, often without our conscious attention. Turns out, our olfactory nerves connect directly to the amygdala, bypassing the thalamus that filters other sensory input. That makes smell the sense with the most direct route to memory and emotion, making perfumery applied psychophysics, not just cosmetic indulgence.</p>
        <p>The more I read about scents and their effects on us, the more curious I became, and the more I wanted to test out the links for myself. That curiosity resulted in me buying my first bottle of perfume, a clone of Versace Eros Eau de Parfum (the real bottle costs S$165, money I couldn't afford to simply throw around). With a mint and candy apple opening giving way to a floral sage base, the Eros EDP was a perfect way to start. Not only was it a great-smelling fragrance, it was also decently complex. Fresh candy apple and mint opened with a blast, like cold lemonade on a summer afternoon. As the top notes evaporated, they gave way to an woody  and floral heart -- made of Ambroxan, Geranium and Clary Sage. As an aromatic-fougere, by the second hour, once the heart has evaporated, Eros settles down with warm, sweet elegance thanks to its vanilla, sandalwood and patchouli base. It was also this fragrance that made me realise that fragrances can and should be complex. That fragrances, like humans, have depth. Character. And that complexity only makes it all the more alluring.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have owned many more scents in small (2ml) amounts. From Chanel's BdC EDT to Dior's Sauvage EDT to L'Artisan Parfumeur's Passage d'Enfer EDT. I have tried blue scents, green scents, designers and niche, oriental and fresh. Each new fragrance deepened my understanding of the complex interplay of scents in a single bottle.</p>
        <p>And so, I decided to start experimenting. Early attempts were as simple as layering fragrances. (Layering is the process of applying a fragrance on top of another. This allows notes to mix as layers evaporate, creating complex but beautiful mixtures of notes -- eg floral & citrus, woody & spicy). My favourite layers are V&R's Spicebomb Night Vision EDP as a base, with Issey Miyake's L'eau D'Issey Pour Homme EDT on top. This allows the warm floral citrus of L'Eau D'Issey to mix with the spicy woody notes of Spicebomb.</p>
        <p>More recently, I have been trying to make my own fragrances from scratch. Using fragrance fixatives and perfumery oils from Taobao (they are much cheaper there than on Amazon), I have taken my first steps into this wonderful hobby.</p>
        <p>Of course, making fragrances is a completely new beast compared to simply appreciating them. One needs a great deal of patience, creativity and a really good nose. For example, your nose needs to be able to differentiate between the various floral notes (lavender, clary sage, geranium, saffron, lotus, lily-of-the-valley...), the various woody bases (cedar, sandalwood, oud, incense, vetiver, oak, cypress...). Think that's hard enough already? Wait till you've learnt that there are three types of vetiver used in fragrance! (Haitian Vetiver, Javanese Vetiver, and Bourbon Vetiver)</p>
        <p>And just like neural networks, the notes interact with each other in mysterious ways. For example, lily-of-the-valley and frankincense produces a mysterious, gothic church after the rain vibe, even though I've never actually been to a church before. (I'm classified as a free thinker) You see, fragrance bottles are quite the black boxes!</p>
        <p>But that's the fun of it all. Experimenting, learning, discovering. Each fragrance is a new adventure, a new story waiting to be told. And I can't wait to see where this fragrant journey takes me next.</p>
