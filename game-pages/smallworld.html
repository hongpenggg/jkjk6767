        <h2>PART I: The Start of Life</h2>
        <p>“Shhhh…”</p>
        <p>The woman’s mouth forms a perfect oval. Exaggerated. Almost comical. Her jaw drops in a way that makes her five-year-old giggle uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>“Again,” she insists in Chinese. “Tongue behind teeth. Shhhh…”</p>
        <p>Her child tries. Something emerges: half-Chinese, half-English… Entirely wrong. She groans softly. This is the fifth time. The worn phonics book between them shows a hilariously large illustration of a shell, mocking the pair with its cheerful simplicity.</p>

        <p>That… Was my mother, an ex-English teacher from Guangzhou trapped in a Singaporean apartment with a hyperactive child starting kindergarten in a month. 26 letters. 44 phonemes. And 30 days to teach it to her kid from nothing.</p>
        <p>Until five, I had been living with my grandparents in China: Yeye teaching me Tang dynasty poems I’d recite without understanding, and Nainai explaining how to fold geometrically-perfect dumplings, mastered from decades as a housewife.</p>
        <p>And all hell broke loose when I was summoned back across the South China Sea. To a place where English, not Mandarin, was used. Where not speaking English marks you as ‘remedial’ before you’ve learnt what remedial means.</p>
        <p>My first week at kindergarten, I sat silent during every lesson. I was a node, disconnected from the network that was my class. Ms Ke, my form teacher, would often crouch beside my desk and translate everything to Chinese, her patience seemingly infinite. Classmates would repeatedly mouth difficult words, turning English lessons into collaborative debugging sessions.</p>
        <p>My childhood taught me how community forms through necessity. How displaced kids survived through distributed support systems: my mum’s stubbornness, drilling phonics until her jaw ached; teachers willing to code-switch mid-lesson; classmates who treated my language gap like a shared problem… That kid who couldn’t pronounce “shell” now thinks in English, dreams in two languages, and codes in Python. </p>
        <p>I want to build systems like the one that built me: adaptive, collaborative, and refusing to abandon the nodes that start disconnected. Community is a strange thing: often, it’s defined as individual care folding into one’s collective identity. But for me, it represents the people who debug your errors until you finally compile.</p>
