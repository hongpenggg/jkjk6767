        <h2>PART I: The Start of Life</h2>
        <p>“Shhhh…”</p>
        <p>The woman’s mouth forms a perfect oval. Exaggerated. Almost comical. Her jaw drops in a way that makes her five-year-old giggle uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>“Again,” she insists in Chinese. “Tongue behind teeth. Shhhh…”</p>
        <p>He tries. Something emerges: half-Chinese, half-English… Entirely wrong. She groans softly. This is the fifth time. The worn phonics book between them shows a hilariously large illustration of a shell, mocking the pair with its cheerful simplicity.</p>

        <p>That… Was my mother, an ex-English teacher from Guangzhou, trapped in a Singaporean apartment with her hyperactive child starting school in a month. 26 letters. 44 phonemes. And 30 days to teach it to her kid from nothing.</p>

        <p>Until five, I had been living with my grandparents in China: Yeye teaching me Tang dynasty poems I’d recite without understanding, and Nainai explaining how to fold geometrically-perfect dumplings, mastered from decades as a housewife.</p>

        <p>And all hell broke loose when I was summoned back across the South China Sea. To a place where English, not Mandarin, was used. Where not speaking English marks you as ‘remedial’ before you’ve learnt what remedial means.</p>

        <p>My first week in school, I sat silent during every lesson. I was a node, disconnected from the network that was my class. Ms Ke, my form teacher, would often crouch beside my desk and translate everything to Chinese, her patience seemingly infinite. Classmates would repeatedly mouth difficult words, turning English lessons into collab sessions. All the help and support of my teachers and classmates, made learning English feel easier. Instead of a war that I needed to fight alone, it felt more like a late-night team debugging session. And so, I studied even harder, because I knew I had my tribe behind me. </p>

        <p>My childhood taught me how community forms through necessity. How displaced kids survived through distributed support systems: my mum’s stubbornness, drilling phonics until her jaw ached; teachers willing to code-switch mid-lesson; classmates who treated my language gap like a shared problem… That kid who couldn’t pronounce “shell” now thinks in English, dreams in two languages, and codes in Python (and JS and hopefully soon, C-sharp!!). </p>
        <p>I want to build systems like the one that built me: adaptive, collaborative, and refusing to abandon the nodes that start disconnected. I am fortunate to have amazing classmates and teachers who were willing to go out of their way to help me catch up. But the truth is, not all kids in Singapore are so fortunate. Some kids don't have mums who conveniently happened to be an English teacher. Some kids immigrate late, and are thrown head-first into learning in English. Some kids' parents work long shifts and never manage to find time to help them out in school... I want to help these kids. I want to help them learn, give them an equal starting point, and support them in their educational journey the same way my parents, teachers and classmates did.</p>
        <p>Community is a strange thing: often, it’s defined as individual care folding into one’s collective identity. But for me, it represents the people who debug your errors until you finally compile.</p>

            <figcaption>Come play pronunciation with me!</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>

        <h2>Come try pronouncing with me!</h2>
        <p>To mimic learning how to pronounce new words in English, let's try pronouncing some words in Chinese!</p>
        <p>The Chinese word for school is "学校" (xuéxiào). Try saying it out loud based on the phonetic spelling!</p>
        <p>Did you get it? The difficulty in pronouncing this word comes from the 'X' character. Common to Chinese, the 'X' combined with 'u' is pronounced with a 'sh' sound. Think: shoo! The 'e' behind the 'Xu' means that xue is pronounced like "shoo-where"! (But faster)</p>
        <p>Now, try pronouncing the second word, 'Xiao'. Say it out loud! The accent on top of the 'a' indicates that you should say the 'ao' in a "'downwards' tone. Unlike 'xue', 'xiao' is pronounced like the English 'x'. 'Xylophone', for example. Hence, 'xiao' is actually read as: 'see-ow' (transition fast!)</p>
        <p>Okay! Here comes! How do you pronounce thank you (谢谢, xièxiè) in Chinese? This determines if you can move to the next chapter!! >:)</p>
