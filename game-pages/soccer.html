        <h2>Well Done!</h2>
        <p>Lovely to see that you're on your tippy toes! Come explore my next hobby with me: soccer!</p>
        <p>Soccer is really a sport that I love. I adore the feeling of running on the field with the ball at your feet, trying to find the most creative ways to beat defenders in hot pursuit. Many people like doing fancy tricks like Elasticos and Marseille Turns, but what I've learnt -- in soccer and in life -- is that sometimes the simplest tricks are the most effective. (Just ask Messi with his La Croqueta!)</p>
        <p>Fun fact: I didn't really enjoy soccer at first, when my mum sent me to sunday classes at the local soccer clinic. To me, going out in the hot afternoon sun (at 3pm, nevertheless) was the worst way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Also, the coaches thought I was too untalented, clumsy and slow to be a good player, so I was always either sent to the kids class (under-7s, but I was already 9) or left to do my own things in goal (when I did get allowed to play with the under-12s). Not that I minded though. To the younger me, soccer was just not my cup of tea. In fact, I thought the best part of my Sundays was that my mum would allow me two hours of TV time after soccer practice as a reward. Sweet!</p>
        <p>And so, from when I eventually did leave the academy (at age 11) until I eventually picked the sport up again (at age 15), I had always thought that I wasn't cut out for soccer. Or any sport for that matter. When other kids talked about the latest Premier League matches between Chelsea and Manchester United, or about who was the better player between Messi and Ronaldo, I stood to the side. Soccer's not my cup of tea, I would quietly tell myself.</p>

        <p>But then, something changed in 2020. Faced with the pandemic-induced lockdowns in Singapore, having exhausted the option of watching all the latest TV shows and movies online and with very little actual hobbies, I decided to give soccer a shot. Again. Not as a kid going unwillingly to soccer clinic, but as a teenager discovering a new interest, as a spectator to the professional game.</p>

            <br>
        </figure>
        
        <p>The more I watched old match replays and professional player highlights, the more I realised what soccer meant. It's not just a game. It's the beautiful game. It's the sport that connects billions of people around the world -- from the English to the French to the Americans to the Brazilians to the Japanese. It was a bridge that crossed barriers. Language ones. Socioeconomic ones. Physical ones and mental ones. As long as you have a heart and passion, you can pick up soccer: Pele learned to play soccer with a "ball" made of old socks and newspapers.</p>
        <p>For many adults, soccer represents a form of therapy, a way to escape the stresses of daily life and connect with others through shared passion and excitement. For many of us, it's a reminder that despite our differences, we can all come together for something greater than ourselves. But for many children around the world, soccer represents a dream. A dream of a better life, where they no longer need to starve and can take care of their families as professional players. A dream of representing their country on the world stage.</p>

            <figcaption>Me and my friends playing a pick-up game of beach soccer with our newfound Kenyan friends from the US. Soccer does connect people from all parts of the world!</figcaption>
            <br>
        </figure>

        <p>When eleven people stand together on a field, with the shared goal of winning the match, they become one. They stand together, attack together, defend together, win together and lose together. Yes -- you need hard work and determination and curiosity and passion to improve your own skills, but you also need teamwork, collaboration, support, empathy and communication if you want to win as a team. And few matches are won as an individual. Perhaps, in its own way, soccer inspires all of us to dream, to hope, to love, and to believe.</p>
        <p>As for me, I eventually picked up soccer again as soon as the lockdowns ended. Inspired by famous players like René Higuita, Joe Hart and Manuel Neuer, I took to the field again as a goalkeeper. Proudly, this time. The starting months were rough. Years of not playing meant that I had to de-rust all of my old skills. It also meant that I had to re-learn many basic skills like passing and kicking to become better. And I am glad that in that journey, I had many classmates who stood behind me. They never failed to call me down for a game or simply to take shots at the goal so that I could improve.</p>

            <br>
        </figure>

        <p>With lots of hard work, time on the field, and hours on YouTube watching Neuer and Alisson highlights, I became a better keeper than I ever thought I could be. At 16, after less than two years of playing in school, I made the junior college varsity soccer team (although as second-choice keeper). I even started on a match against an extremely strong competitor (you've probably heard of them: Raffles Institution) and kept a clean sheet (zero goals conceded)!</p>

        <p>Today, I have become a much better player than I was at eleven. I eventually moved to become an outfield player (midfielder/winger + striker) and started playing in amateur league clubs. I am proud to say that soccer has become more than just a hobby for me. It has become a way of life. Its lessons -- of passion, curiosity, hard work, and teamwork -- inspire me to push myself both physically and academically. I want to take the toughest courses, solve the hardest puzzles (often the human ones) and help others fall in love with life and the continuous process of improving ourselves. I am making ameliorating educational inequality in Singapore my goal, because I hope to give underprivileged children an opportunity to excel, just like soccer once gave me.</p>
